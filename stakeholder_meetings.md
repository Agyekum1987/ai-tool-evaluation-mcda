# Stakeholder Meeting Notes
**Project:** ATD AI Logistics Tool Selection

## Meeting 1: Requirements Elicitation
**Date:** April 15, 2025
**Attendee:** Susan Namulindwa, Trade Enablement Lead
**Method:** Semi-structured interview

### Key Discussion Points:
- ATD operates with lean teams (1-5 users), no dedicated IT department
- Must move to "AI-First" operations rather than just AI-assisted
- Primary concern: Tools must work in low-infrastructure African markets (Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya)
- Budget constraint: Solutions must be SME-friendly (no enterprise pricing)

### Requirements Captured:
- FR-001: Tool must require &lt;2 days training for non-technical staff
- FR-002: Must operate on mobile devices (field access)
- NFR-001: Must comply with both Canadian and African data privacy laws

**Method:** Process walkthrough

### Current State Pain Points:
